# A* Algorithm

## Description
This project contains a UI visualization of 2D heuristic pathfinding. The A* Algorithm then finds a path between user-set start and end points, balancing short path distance and quick calculations, all while avoiding obstacles.

## Installation & Use
1) Clone the repository by copying the HTTPS link into the IDE of your choice
2) Run the enviroment.py file
3) Edit key path points by selecting the start (red) and end (green) menu options
4) Add obstacles by selecting the obstacle (black) menu option
5) Choose to visualize either the final path, or the proccess, using the visualization toggle (white) menu option
6) Notice the computation time highlighted in the top right
